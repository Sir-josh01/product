## Overview
  Product preview card component is an interesting project that requires just HTML and CSS only to build. It is a good test to my developing skills in HTML and CSS.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements
